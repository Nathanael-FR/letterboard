<!-- # README: Web Scraping with Multithreading and Multiprocessing in Python

## Introduction

This Python script demonstrates how to efficiently scrape multiple web pages using both **multithreading** and **multiprocessing**. These techniques allow us to perform multiple tasks concurrently, significantly speeding up tasks that are I/O-bound (like web scraping).

### What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites. It involves fetching web pages and parsing the content to retrieve specific information. In this script, we are scraping book titles and prices from an online book store.

## Concepts Explained

### Multithreading

**Multithreading** is a technique where multiple threads run concurrently within a single process. Threads are the smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system. 

- **When to Use Multithreading**: Multithreading is useful for tasks that are I/O-bound, such as reading/writing files, network requests, or database operations. These tasks spend a lot of time waiting for input/output operations to complete. By using multiple threads, the CPU can switch to another thread while waiting for I/O operations to finish.

- **How Multithreading Works in the Script**:
  - The script creates multiple threads, each responsible for scraping a specific page.
  - Threads are managed within each process to handle multiple pages in parallel.

### Multiprocessing

**Multiprocessing** involves running multiple processes simultaneously. Each process has its own memory space, and they can run independently on different CPU cores.

- **When to Use Multiprocessing**: Multiprocessing is beneficial for CPU-bound tasks where the CPU is the bottleneck, such as numerical computations or data processing. It allows you to fully utilize multiple CPU cores by running separate processes on each core.

- **How Multiprocessing Works in the Script**:
  - The script creates multiple processes using the `multiprocessing` library.
  - Each process manages its own set of threads to scrape a range of pages. This allows for parallel execution on multiple CPU cores, enhancing the script’s efficiency.

## How the Script Works

1. **Setup**: 
   - The script begins by importing necessary libraries and defining constants, such as the base URL for scraping.

2. **Scraping Function (`scrape_page`)**:
   - A function is defined to scrape a single page. It sends an HTTP request, parses the response to extract book titles and prices, and stores them in a queue.

3. **Thread Worker Function (`thread_worker`)**:
   - This function is responsible for managing multiple pages within a single thread. It iterates over page numbers and calls the `scrape_page` function for each.

4. **Process Worker Function (`process_worker`)**:
   - This function creates multiple threads within a single process. Each thread scrapes a specific page and stores results in a thread-safe queue.

5. **Main Execution Block**:
   - The main script sets up multiprocessing by creating a manager object and shared queue.
   - It initializes multiple processes, each handling a specific range of pages using `process_worker`.
   - Finally, it collects all results and outputs the total time taken to scrape the books.

## How to Run the Script

1. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install requests beautifulsoup4
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   Simply run the Python script from the command line:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   This will start the scraping process using multithreading and multiprocessing. -->
